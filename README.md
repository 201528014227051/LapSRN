### Introduction
The Laplacian Pyramid Super-Resolution Network (LapSRN) is a progressive super-resolution model that super-resolves an low-resolution images in a coarse-to-fine Laplacian pyramid framework.
Our method is fast and achieves state-of-the-art performance on many benchmark datasets.
For more details and evaluation results, please check out our [project webpage](http://vllab1.ucmerced.edu/~wlai24/LapSRN/) and [paper](http://vllab1.ucmerced.edu/~wlai24/LapSRN/papers/cvpr17_LapSRN.pdf).
